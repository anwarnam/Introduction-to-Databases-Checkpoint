Slide 1: Introduction

Title: MongoDB vs SQL

Brief Introduction: 
MongoDB and SQL are two types of databases used for storing and managing data. While both serve the same fundamental
 purpose, they have significant differences in their architecture and functionality.




Slide 2: MongoDB

Title: MongoDB

Description: 

MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database, which means it stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.

Functionality:

1- Schema-less: MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, allowing for more flexibility in data structure.
2- Scalability: Designed to handle large volumes of data and high throughput, making it suitable for big data applications.
3- High Performance: Utilizes indexing and other optimization techniques for fast querying.
4- Replication and Sharding: Built-in support for replication and sharding for high availability and horizontal scaling.




Slide 3: SQL (Structured Query Language)

Title: SQL

Description:
 SQL is a language used for managing relational databases, which store data in tables with predefined schemas.
Functionality:
1- Data Integrity: Enforces ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to maintain data integrity.
2- Transactions: Supports transactions, allowing multiple operations to be grouped together and executed atomically.
3- Standardized: SQL is a standardized language, widely supported by various database management systems.
4- Complex Queries: Allows for complex querying using SQL statements like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.




Slide 4: Comparison

Title: Comparison

1-MongoDB:
~ Schema-less
~ Suitable for unstructured and semi-structured data
~ Horizontal scalability with built-in support for sharding
~ JSON-like document storage
~ Flexible data modeling

2-SQL:
~Relational database with a predefined schema
~Suitable for structured data
~ACID compliance ensures data integrity
~Vertical scalability
~Standardized querying language (SQL)






Slide 5: Use Cases and Conclusion

Title: Use Cases and Conclusion

Use Cases:

~ MongoDB: Ideal for applications with evolving data schemas, real-time analytics, and high-volume data storage 
requirements.

~ SQL: Well-suited for applications requiring strict data integrity, complex queries, and transactional support.

Conclusion: 
Choosing between MongoDB and SQL depends on the specific requirements of the application. While MongoDB offers 
flexibility and scalability for certain use cases, SQL provides strong consistency and data integrity for others. 
Ultimately, the decision should be based on factors such as data structure, scalability needs, and transactional 
requirements.
